# Marcel Kalveram's Personal Website

This is my personal website, built using the [Spotlight](https://tailwindui.com/templates/spotlight) template from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) as a starting point. I've extensively modified and refactored the original template to suit my personal needs and preferences, customizing the design, content structure, and functionality.

The site is built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

To run this project, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.
