In this post, I'd like to explore the role of the software engineer in the world of product development, how it is impacted by AI, and what we can expect from this transformation.

### TL;DR

- AI enables engineers to spend less time on mundane tasks, freeing up their time for more business-relevant outcomes
- AI-enabled engineers with product experience—similar to indie hackers—take part in the whole product development lifecycle
- Hiring product engineers is a resource-efficient way for companies—especially startups—to build products users want

## Engineering and AI

I don't think AI is going to replace software engineers. But since it enables us to automate many chores, we can dedicate more time to tasks that matter, such as solving real user pain points.

The shift from purely writing software to spending more time on the product and its users already gave rise to a role that's gaining a lot of traction: the product engineer.

### What exactly is a product engineer?

Let me quote the definition provided by the team at Posthog:

> A product engineer, at its most basic, is a software engineer building products. They do similar work to software engineers: writing code and shipping features. [...] What makes them unique is their focus on creating a product for users.

I would even go as far as saying that product engineers are the indie hackers of the modern startup. They don't only know how to deliver software but also care deeply about validating it against the market.

This role becomes even more exciting with the rise of AI. Let's explore why!

## AI makes coding cheaper

AI can write pretty good code and returns complex algorithms based on prompts that take a fraction of the time to write.

Of course, the output often contains bugs, and debugging them is a lot easier with a strong software development background. AI assistants like Copilot and Cursor AI obviously speed this process up significantly.

Also, AI development could reinforce biases and automate bad practices if not closely monitored. But let's imagine a world where all of this has been perfected to a point where you rarely have bugs and biases.

Most programmers should gain a lot of time, time they can spend on software design, architectural decisions or playing ping pong.

In the worst case—the dystopia we all fear—is that engineers become obsolete. In an ideal world though, aren't we now simply able to ship software faster?

Maybe, but speed doesn't automatically match better outcomes. You can write new features in less time, but someone still needs to make sure that products are aligned with users' actual needs and solve meaningful problems.

While that may not be the case for quantitative feedback, qualitative feedback is still more valuable to gather deep insights into a user's behaviour and motivation.

## Say hi to the Product Engineer

With their technical expertise and focus on the user the product engineer is well positioned to benefit from this transformation.

If writing code takes less time, the product engineer can spend more time on other stages of the product development lifecycle, such as user discovery, product strategy and analytics, thus becoming a more holistic product expert.

Let me dig deeper into what I think are the responsibilities of the AI-enabled product engineer of the future:

### Product Discovery

Most product development starts at this stage: analysing your users, gathering insights, and understanding the market and your competitors.

As of now, this doesn't seem like a task that AI can do autonomously, even though it can aid in the process. It requires:

- Empathy
- Real conversations
- Deep insights analysis

Activities at this stage usually involve lots of calls, whiteboarding, brainstorming sessions and stakeholder meetings.

Tools like Gong.io or Fireflies are great at accurately transcribing calls and running prompts on the results. I think they're becoming an indispensable tool in product discovery.

But interpreting those insights, eliminating bias and errors, and identifying the signal among the noise is a task that requires human reasoning, experience and intuition.

### Product Strategy

While I wouldn't expect developers to be experts in business strategy, there are enough strategic decisions in the product lifecycle that an engineer has to take on a daily basis.

It includes:

- backlog prioritisation
- defining roadmaps
- aligning with business

Doing this requires some degree of business acumen and a lot of product experience. It involves planning, anticipation, domain expertise, and continually re-evaluating priorities.

While LLMs can be very good at supporting you in this process, providing deep factual analysis and research capabilities, they don't possess the same level of intuition as a human brain.

That's where we are still at an advantage because we can feel how certain decisions play out in the future and envision their consequences in the real world.

### Product Delivery

Last but not least, I want to cover some technical tasks that I think AI is still struggling with as well:

- technical architecture
- system design
- migrations and refactoring

They require a lot of context around the codebase and its nuances, but also an understanding of the product objectives; Tasks that require reasoning, spatial thinking, and a lot of nitty-gritty configuration work.

AI is great at supporting us in this process, but it is probably too soon for an AI to autonomously plan, design and deliver custom product experiences, or refactor and migrate large parts of a codebase, especially when a system is highly distributed and complex.

## The future?

Product engineers are well-positioned to tackle each of these areas. They understand both, the technical implications of product decisions, and can empthasise with users. These skills and the ability to employ AI at each of these steps make them a valuable part of a resource-efficient product team.

This doesn't mean non-technical people can't utilise AI to the same extent. Also, UX designers, business analysts, and product managers bring a depth of expertise that engineers, even AI-empowered ones, might not easily acquire. Most often, it's the discussions between people from diverse roles that lead to the most interesting results.

However, engineers can use no-code tools efficiently and build prototypes quickly. Combined with an eye for good design and an intuition for what users want, this is a skill which can accelerate product development significantly.

Don't get me wrong. I don't expect all engineers to become product experts. Despite the advances of AI, there's still a ton of deep technical expertise required for highly technical roles.

From a business perspective though, it's an exciting opportunity: product engineers can contribute at all levels of the product development lifecycle, potentially resulting in less communication overhead and fewer disagreements and misunderstandings. The upsides are increased productivity, better alignment on user goals and increased user satisfaction.
