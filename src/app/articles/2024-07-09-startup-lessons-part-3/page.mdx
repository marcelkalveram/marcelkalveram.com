This is the last and final post in this mini-series on the lessons I learned as the Engineering and Product Lead at my previous job. In this part, I'll discuss the challenges of moving from Engineering to Product.

The transition happened in two phases: first, I took on the Product Owner role, which was a fairly seamless move because it didn't happen from one day to the next, and I felt very confident in my responsibilities.

When aiming to become a Product Manager, though, I had to undergo a major shift in responsibilities and mindset. In this post, I would like to share in more detail what went well along the way and where I failed in my new role.

## 👷‍♂️ Lessons as the Product Owner

As mentioned in my last post, I started my journey as the Engineering Lead by growing our team beyond one person.

Once we scaled to two engineers, my role became more like that of a Product Owner. I planned the upcoming epics, resolved dependencies, and ultimately wrote all of the user stories that went into each iteration.

That said, being technical as a Product Owner is a huge advantage when gauging feature development speed and complexity. But it also comes at the cost of constantly being pulled—deliberately or not—into engineering matters.

### There's always more work than you can do

I certainly enjoyed the increased level of abstraction, though. I did less hands-on coding work (which was always time-consuming) and worried more about how features and improvements to the platform fit into the overall picture, figuring out how many stories could go into an iteration based on the available engineering capacities.

One realisation I soon had was that no matter how accurately you structure your backlog or try to predict a roadmap, the reality of unexpected bugs and unplanned work always catches up with you.

The question then is: Is the planning hassle worth it, or isn't it better to embrace and prepare for the unpredictable nature of product development and instead shift the approach towards tolerating chaos?

In my experience, the primary skill I had to develop was a sense of what is most valuable from a user perspective and always deprioritising (almost) everything else. As painful as it may be for a developer's soul, refactoring often had to take a back seat.

### Balancing everyone's interests

Pushing new features regularly while addressing bugs and chores was also a constant challenge. In addition to striking the right balance between velocity and quality, it's important to consider the interests of different stakeholders:

- **The user**: which features do they request, and which bugs do they experience?
- **The engineering team**: when and how do we address code quality and technical debt?
- **The broader team**: what problems do they experience with the platform? Which ideas for improvement do they have?
- **The founder**: which business opportunities are there? Are initiatives aligned with the company North Star?
- **Investors**: how do they want to see you evolve?
  It's inevitable to be pulled in different directions constantly. My biggest challenge as a Product Owner was reconciling everyone's interests and aligning engineering work with stakeholder interests.

The advantage of being technical in this role is that you can easily relate to the engineer's problems. However, gathering user feedback, listening to the broader team, and respecting the founder's direction is a challenge that requires skills beyond good planning and communication.

During my journey, I came across a few excellent books which helped me navigate some of the challenges I faced with increasing team-related responsibilities:

- [Managing Humans](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484271157): Provided practical advice on managing tech teams of different sizes in an entertaining way
- [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-of-Team-audiobook/dp/B000079XXR): a classic which examines the most common issues in teams and how to address them
- [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/The-Managers-Path-audiobook/dp/B07SV4VDWC): a book about the stages of technical management, from mentoring to working with senior staff

### Shifting responsibility to people

At some point, being the bottleneck for planning and speccing every single bug and feature didn't make sense anymore. As soon as I felt that other team members had gained enough experience and they felt comfortable with it, too, we decided to split up the planning work. This happened in two stages:

1. **Writing user stories**: as I shifted to the Product Owner role, I encouraged people to create these themselves. Whenever someone stumbled upon a bug or requested an improvement, they could go ahead with a new story based on a predefined template, which we'd later 'triage' together (at some point, we actually had a 'triage' stage in our pipeline which helped us see all these issues at a glance)
2. **Writing epic specs**: At a later stage, we lifted planning to the epic level so that engineers not only considered how to implement a story but also got a broader understanding of the planning and prioritisation process. This only happened after I became the Product Manager, though, and required a more thorough handover process. Basically, each developer had to properly spec an epic, think it through, and break it down into smaller stories.

Splitting up the planning work across the whole engineering team—especially at an epic level—had plenty of benefits:

- It freed up more of my time
- I wasn't the only one to decide how to tackle a problem
- I did less upfront thinking about implementation issues
- Everyone started to think more broadly about software design
- Everyone had to take on more ownership and responsibility

These changes helped lay the groundwork for speeding up my transition from Engineering to Product. They enabled me to think more deeply about product decisions and took many of the day-to-day engineering concerns off my plate.

## 👔 Moving to the Product Manager Role

Transitioning from Product Owner to Product Manager was challenging, and given my engineering background, it introduced a couple of additional challenges I needed to familiarise myself with.

Even though I've always been part of product design and strategy in previous jobs, my responsibility was always more focused on finding engineering solutions than making product decisions.

### The Product Discovery Process

Most importantly, the shift required me to consider the Product from a business perspective rather than obsessing about technical details. So I contacted some friends who work in Product and asked them for advice.

One of the best recommendations was Teresa Torres's book [Continuous Discovery Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Discovery-Habits-Discover-Products/dp/1736633309), which provided invaluable guidance. The framework she proposes seemed like the perfect fit for our team's capabilities and needs, and each idea, from identifying opportunities to narrowing down on solutions, perfectly aligned with what I had previously learned about Product Discovery and what we were already doing.

Putting it into practice, though, is a challenge if you already have a product lifecycle that yields visible—even though not always the most valuable—results quickly. Inevitably, you'll face resistance when things slow down at the analysis stage. The framework's purpose is to:

- Identify the most valuable opportunities
- Fully derisk the corresponding solution(s) before implementing them

There were two issues, though:

- **The "ship it" mentality** was still more compelling, and even though I'm a big fan of it, I felt like the volume of possible features and improvements vs. our engineering capabilities warranted a more careful, deliberate approach.
- **The Product Trio**: We needed a UX/UI designer with a visual, creative mindset to complement our product team. While not a dealbreaker, this made the framework less workable from the start.

**Additional resources**
Besides 'Continuous Discovery Habits', here are some other great books I'd recommend for anyone struggling in the Product Discovery phase:

- [Escaping The Build Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Escaping-Build-Trap-Effective-Management/dp/149197379X): Helped me understand the importance of focusing on outcomes rather than outputs.
- [User Story Mapping](https://www.amazon.com/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909): Improved how I organised and communicated product requirements more clearly.
- [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339): Provided insights into high-performing technology organisations and what they focus on
- [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup): Offered a fresh perspective on the product development lifecycle at Basecamp.

### Alignment with Business Strategy

Aligning product objectives with the overall business strategy and ensuring that the roadmap reflected both short-term and long-term goals has been a challenge I have faced since joining the team, but now I had (some) more time to dedicate to it.

I implemented tools and practices that improved team communication and project tracking. My favourite tool for the job was [Airfocus](https://airfocus.com/). It's a modular product management platform that helped me bring structure into a couple of essential elements of the product lifecycle:

- Gather user feedback and assign it to potential opportunities.
- Get a high-level overview of all product initiatives and align them with business objectives (the so-called objective-led roadmap)
- Create a public-facing product roadmap.
- Break down big initiatives into smaller epics, then sync them into Shortcut.

We revisited and reconsidered these high-level objectives in quarterly and yearly goal-setting sessions. Most of the product strategy resulted from analysing user needs and engineering capabilities and aligning everything with the company's North Star.

At this stage, I lacked experience as a product manager, and it was easy for me to lose sight of the critical business goals when still dedicating time to lower-level operational work as the Product Owner and—partly—engineering and designer roles. Ultimately, my dilemma was not realising what to prioritise in this situation because it was complex and only became evident when taking a huge step back (after being laid off).

Nevertheless, I highly recommend the book [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Strategy-audiobook/dp/B07R6XQ8YP). It was an invaluable resource that helped me learn more about strategic thinking and how to differentiate yourself from the competition by carefully analysing and choosing what to do and, more importantly, what not to do.

### Talking to and learning from users

One of the things I was most interested in when talking to friends working in Product positions was how often they interviewed users. While I already knew that user interviews play an essential role in every successful product team, I needed help creating a constant and reliable pipeline of user interviews.

One friend suggested getting on sales calls, and another one talked to users when sharing progress on early feature development. A former colleague even built a platform to automate recruiting and interviewing. But as much as all of their advice made sense to me, my interviewing efforts never picked up steam for several reasons:

- As someone working behind the scenes, I didn't have a direct line to users, so scheduling interviews always had to go through other team members, who were already extremely busy.
- Clustering and assigning user feedback to actual opportunities was not a process I could make transparent and compelling enough for the whole team to follow.
- Other product and engineering responsibilities got in the way, and I couldn't make interviews a high priority with everything else I had going on.

If given another chance, I would prioritise this aspect more heavily and make sure that interviewing users is my number one priority, not only deprioritising other tasks but also making sure I'm not the bottleneck in other areas of the business, such as engineering.

The last book I recommend for today, which was massively useful in the user interviews I conducted, was [The Mom Test](https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742). It taught me how to gather valuable customer feedback without bias and understand in great detail how to lead successful interviews and ask the right questions.

## Other challenges

While the above were necessary learning experiences that I know how to address myself in the future, there were, of course, other factors that I couldn't influence and played a major role in my trajectory:

- **Dynamic Startup Environment**: a fast-paced startup environment can derail your efforts from one day to another, with goals and responsibilities changing daily. It would help if you were extremely flexible and resilient to perform under these circumstances.
- **Roles and responsibilities** are often shared in a startup, with people wearing multiple hats, leading to occasional conflicts and inefficiencies. Defining them at a high level early on definitely helps avoid the most frustrating ones.
- **Managing Multiple User Groups**: Developing a two-sided marketplace where you need to consider the needs of two or more user groups adds complexity to planning and execution. It's also an important strategic concern to decide which of these user groups you want to target and how.

## What's next?

That's a wrap. I hope I've been able to share some insightful lessons from my roles as an Engineering Lead, Product Owner and Product Manager.

You may ask yourself now? Well, how did it end? While I'm unable to disclose the exact reasons for my departure, I don't mind sharing that while I'm excited and passionate about Product, I'm more comfortable as an engineer building products or a Product Owner working at the intersection of Product and Engineering.

Product management is an area I enjoy a lot but which is not fully aligned with my skill set, purpose and experience. As an engineer at heart, I find it challenging to embrace the job's unpredictable and sometimes chaotic nature, especially in an early-stage startup.

That said, I'm currently open for contract work. If you have an exciting challenge and are looking for an engineer to help you build your next idea or augment your team with an experienced Product Engineer, feel free to reach out via the contact options on the [About](/about) page.

Thanks so much for reading!
